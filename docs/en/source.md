```java
// Get query parameters generated by this framework can be used to check whether the query parameters generated by this framework are correct
String getSource(LambdaEsQueryWrapper<T> wrapper);
```
> **Tips:**
> The production environment can call this interface before calling the query of this framework, and record the obtained query parameters (JSONString) in the log, so that when a problem occurs, it can be checked whether the query generated by the framework itself has incorrect parameters. Of course, in the later stable version We will discard this method because it is of little significance at present.After a lot of testing, the query parameters generated by the framework have not found any problems.
>
>In version 0.9.7+, users no longer need to manually call this interface to obtain DSL statements, which are printed on the console by default. If the production environment needs to be closed, please configure print-dsl=false in the configuration file. For configuration, please refer to the configuration chapter.
