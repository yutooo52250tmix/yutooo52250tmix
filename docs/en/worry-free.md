# 1.Performance

---

Before formally connecting Easy-Es to the production environment, you will definitely worry about a question, that is, after using this framework, will the query efficiency of the system decrease? Will the system resource overhead increase? How much is the negative impact?

These problems are related to the survival of a framework. As an EE author, I have considered these problems before development, but users do not know, so I will help you to crush these concerns one by one.

Let's first look at what EE does in the entire query process? To sum up, there are 2 things:

1. Convert the MySQL syntax (Mybatis-Plus syntax) entered by the user into RestHighLevel syntax, and then call RestHighLevelClient to execute the query
1. Convert the query result into the format the user wants: such as List and return it.

● Among them, the syntax conversion is performed according to the relationship between the EE and RestHighLevelClient syntax comparison table. This conversion actually consumes very low performance, because even if you use RestHighLevelClient to query directly, you still need to create termQueryBuilder and BoolQueryBuilder. The only difference is I put the query conditions eq entered by the user into the queue, and then convert them one by one in the order of the FIFO in the queue (except when there is an or in the query conditions). For most query statements, there are not too many query conditions, so The number of elements in the queue will be less than 10 in most cases, and I only store enumerations and parameters in the queue, which will neither take up too much memory nor consume much performance due to the traversal of the queue. For modern computers , let alone traversing 10 small pieces of data, even hundreds or thousands of pieces of data are in milliseconds, so this performance loss is basically negligible.

● Let’s talk about the result parsing. The result parsing is actually to take out the hits in the SearchResponse returned by calling RestHighLevelClient and convert it into an array with fastJson. Even if you don’t need EE, you will still have this step if you use RestHighLevelClient directly, so there is not too much loss in this step. , even if I use reflection, the reflection and annotation information of the field are loaded into the memory when the framework starts, and the jvm cache is done, so this loss is negligible.

Of course, the above are all based on theoretical analysis. In version 0.9.6, in the Performance test class of the test directory of the Sample module, you can see that I have made performance tests of different dimensions for CURD, and the actual test results are also very good. Based on my theoretical analysis above, EE is 10-15 milliseconds slower on average than using RestHighLevelClient directly, and there is no difference in adding, deleting or modifying the API, and with the increase in the amount of query data, after the entity field cache takes effect, the query difference will be further reduced. , almost negligible. Sacrificing 10 milliseconds is imperceptible to users, but for development, it can save a lot of code and time, I think it's worth it, basically no ORM framework is not depleted Performance, weighing the pros and cons, the protagonists should have the answer psychologically.

# 2.Safety

The bottom layer of EE is the RestHighLevelClient officially provided by Es. We only enhanced RestHighLevelClient, and did not change or weaken its original functions, so you don't need to worry about scalability.

The use of any framework will reduce the flexibility of the system, because the framework is dead. After using it, you will inevitably encounter some scenarios that cannot be satisfied by the framework, which requires customized development, or you do not understand the framework itself in the short term, so dare not rashly. Use it, otherwise what should I do if I encounter problems in the future?

In order to solve the above problems, I specially left [hybrid query](/en/hybrid-query.md) and [native query](/en/origin-query.md) in the framework

At present, all APIs provided by EE can cover 99% of the actual development requirements. When 1% of the requirements cannot be covered in a very small probability, you can use hybrid query, that is, the statements that can be supported are generated by EE, and the statements that cannot be supported can be generated by EE. Just use the syntax of RestHighLevelClient directly, and then complete the query through the native interface, which is simple and hassle-free. Of course, if you don't like this "hybrid oil-electricity" method, you can also directly use the native query interface to complete the query, and directly Same as using RestHighLevelClient.

Of course, if you really don't want to use any of the methods provided by EE, EE can still be used as an auto-configured version of RestHighLevelClient. You can directly inject RestHighLevelClient where you need it for use. EE has already helped you configure RestHighLevelClient as you specified in the configuration file. , is automatically assembled into SpringBean, so in any case, you can be very confident and calm, just like using the official RestHighLevelClient directly, you don't need to worry about what to do if there is a problem one day, don't use EE, just treat it as a A tool that introduces dependencies and automatic configuration. And this possibility is very low. We also have a dedicated Q&A group to give you free online support, and will respond to your reasonable needs as soon as possible and arrange the landing.

In order to solve the above problems, I specially left semi-native queries and full-native queries in the framework

At present, all APIs provided by EE can cover 99% of the actual development requirements. When 1% of the requirements cannot be covered in a very small probability, you can use semi-native queries, that is, the supported statements are generated by EE, and the unsupported statements are generated by EE. The statement directly uses the syntax of RestHighLevelClient, and then completes the query through the semi-native interface, which is simple and hassle-free. Of course, if you do not like this "hybrid" method, you can also directly use the native query interface to complete the query. Same as using RestHighLevelClient directly.

# 4.Team and community activity

---

The team has recruited 5 people, which I call "General Five Tigers". TeamWork has been started since version 0.9.5+. In the future, as the project develops, more people with lofty ideals will be recruited. The community is currently active and will meet every year. Release many versions to continuously improve the user experience. We will respond to the needs of users within a week. If it is reasonable, the project will be established within one month, and the development and launch will be completed within three months. Issues will be resolved within two weeks after confirmation. online.

# 5.Access advantages

---

● Simple, easy to use and efficient, I don't need to say more, MyBatis-Plus users know everything! Save a lot of time, make love...do things, really fragrant!

● The use threshold is lowered, even a novice who just doesn't understand Es can use EE to develop various functions

● Significantly reduce the amount of code, improve code readability, reduce the amount of repetitive code, and improve code quality

● Professional Q&A team, worry-free after-sales

● Free forever

# 6.Conclusion

When the new energy vehicle first came out, the owners of the gas truck were still waiting and watching. Those who got on the car first had already experienced the sweetness. You will know if it is good or not. As for those so-called problems, they will be solved with time. Try new things more, Only by embracing change, not conforming to the old ways, and looking at the ever-changing world without immutable concepts, can you be invincible.
