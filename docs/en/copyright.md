In order to maintain the syntax of this framework consistent with MP, some of the code comes from the open source framework [Mybatis-Plus](https://mp.baomidou.com/), or has been modified, which is specially stated here.

The bottom layer of this framework uses ElasticSearch's official open source framework [RestHighLevelClient](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/index.html), which is specifically stated here.

This framework adopts the same [Apache2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) as Mybatis-plus, and promises to never participate in commercial use, and is only for free use by everyone.
