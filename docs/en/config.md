> **Basic configuration:**
> If it is missing, it can cause the project to fail to start normally

```yaml
easy-es:
  eanble: true # The default value is true, If the value of enable is false, it is considered that Easy-es is not enabled
  address: 127.0.0.0:9200 # Your elasticsearch address,must contains port, If it is a cluster, please separate with',' just like this: 127.0.0.0:9200,127.0.0.1:9200
  username: elastic # Es username, Not necessary, If it is not set in your elasticsearch, delete this line
  password: WG7WVmuNMtM4GwNYkyWH # Es password, Not necessary, If it is not set, delete this line

```
> **Extended configuration:**
> It can be defaulted, in order to improve production performance, you can configure it further (only supported in version 0.9.4+)

```yaml
easy-es:
  connectTimeout: 5000 # Connection timeout unit: ms
  socketTimeout: 5000 # Communication timeout unit: ms
  requestTimeout: 5000 # Request timeout unit: ms
  connectionRequestTimeout: 5000 # Connection request timeout
  maxConnTotal: 100 # Maximum number of connections
  maxConnPerRoute: 100 # Maximum number of connected routes
```
> **Global configuration:**
> Can be defaulted, does not affect the project startup, if the default is the default value

```yaml
easy-es:
  global-config:
    map-underscore-to-camel-case: false # Whether to enable underline to hump default is false (0.9.8+ version support)
    print-dsl: true # Turn on the console to print the DSL statements generated by this framework. It is turned on by default. It is recommended to turn off the production environment (supported by version 0.9.7+)
    db-config:
      map-underscore-to-camel-case: false # Whether to enable underline to hump default is false (0.9.8+ version support)
      table-prefix: dev_ # Index prefix, can be used to distinguish the environment, the default is empty
      id-type: auto # id generation strategy defaults to auto
      field-strategy: not_empty # The field update strategy defaults to not_null, and the field is updated only when the field value is not empty

```
> **Tips:**
> - id-type supports 2 types:
> 
       auto: It is automatically generated by ES and is the default configuration, no additional configuration is          required for you. Recommended
>        uuid: The system generates UUID, and then inserts ES (not recommended)
> - Field-strategy supports 3 types:
>    - not_null: non-Null judgment, only when the field value is non-Null will be updated
>    - not_empty: non-empty judgment, will be updated only when the field value is a non-empty string
>    - ignore: Ignore the judgment, no matter what the field value is, it will be updated
> - After configuring the global policy, you can still customize the configuration for individual classes through annotations, and the priority of the global configuration is lower than the annotation configuration
