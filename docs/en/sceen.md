1. Retrieval services

● Search Libraries<br />● E-commerce product search<br />● Massive system log retrieval

2.  Question-and-answer service (essentially also a retrieval class)

● Online intelligent customer service<br />● Robots

3. Map services

● Taxi app<br />● Food delivery app<br />● Community group purchase and delivery<br />● Socializing with strangers

...<br />The above are just some application scenarios that I can think of. In fact, the API of Easy-Es basically covers more than 90% of the functions of Elastic Search and more than 99% of the common functions, so you can quickly build various systems based on EE, even if It is a very complex and changeable query, and you can also deal with it calmly, Trust me!
