Easy-Es (EE for short) is a low-code development framework based on RestHighLevelClient officially provided by ElasticSearch (Es for short). If you have used Mybatis-Plus (MP for short), then you can basically get started with EE at zero learning cost. EE is an Es replacement version of MP, and it also incorporates more unique functions of Es to help you quickly realize various scenarios. development.
